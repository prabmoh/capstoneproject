## Introduction
Survival in the restaurant industry is difficult, it’s reported that roughly 60% fail within the first 3 years. 
One of the oldest truisms in the restaurant business states that success depends on three things: Location, Location & Location. There could be many variables contributing to the value of location – parking availability, outlook when seated, street appeal, etc.. All these contribute towards the foot traffic.  


Now introduce the added dynamic of target market into the location mix, a restaurant would have a particular target market in mind e.g. An entrepreneur trying to capitalize on the rising vegan trend, focusing on introducing vegan based meals will be focusing on mid-20s to early 40s fitness enthusiasts with a family as his target market.


## Business Problem
The entrepreneur has got his unique value proposition, vegan meals, but he has to get his location sorted. 
Although selecting locations closer to the gyms seems to be the best idea, it’s saturated with a lot of other vegan restaurants/to-go locations which makes it hard to stand out.  


The goal is to figure out locations where you have a lot of foot traffic of the target market with lesser availability of health focused restaurants which will greatly maximize the chances of success for the entrepreneur and the restaurant.
